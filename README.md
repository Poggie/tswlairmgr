TSW Lair Manager
================

**This webapp is in early development and currently still (nearly) non-functional.**

TSW Lair Manager is a fan-made lair fragment organizer for [The Secret World](http://thesecretworld.com) (TSW), a MMORPG by Funcom. It can be used by the leaders or fragment holders of lair groups to easily determine and communicate what fragments group members should pick as their mission reward to maximize the amount of boss summons. Unlike the abandoned / broken / English client only MissionHelper addon, this webapp can be used with an arbitrary number of group members, and lets you see everything at a glance, with nice graphics.

Features:

* Lair bosses from all 8 classic lairs (Solomon Island, Egypt, Transylvania)
* Support for arbitrary group sizes
* On-the-fly TSW chat script generation

TSW Lair Manager can be found at: [http://tsw.nex4k.net/lairs/](http://tsw.nex4k.net/lairs/)

**Note:** all active development takes place in the `master` branch while TSW Lair Manager is still in initial development.

- Lair boss images have been taken from [dancingstar93's Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/79764031@N03/sets/72157638380829154/).
  I derived "x-ray"-esque versions from them using Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended. You can find the PSD files in the resource repository.

- Lair area screenshots have been taken by myself.
  Graphics settings: 2560x1440, DX11, FXAA-HQ, no motion blur, full tesselation, high quality SSAO, brightness=1.0/contrast=1.0/gamma=1.0, all advanced sliders on 4.

- Joakim Bj√∏rnstad ([@joakibj](http://github.com/joakibj)) has strongly inspired me with his [tswcalc](http://github.com/joakibj/tswcalc) webapp to create this one.
